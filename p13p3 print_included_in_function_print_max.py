Implement the program that uses the print_max function from Mondayâ€™s lectures
(Page 9 of the notes).
Ensure that you understand what is going on and how it works.
Save this program as p13p3.py.

PSEUDO CODE
NOTE: This program does not take equal numbers into account.
Define function that PRINTS out the largest of two arguments a, b
    Define max Function that RETURNS the largest of its two arguments a, b
        If a > b:
            Return a
        else:
            Return b      
    Prompt user for number1, a float
    Prompt user for number2, a float
    Print("The largest of", number1, "and", number2, "is", max(number1, number2))
    return
print_max()
