"""   
PROGRAM REQUEST p15p1
Consider the following series, defined recursively as follows:
f(n)= { 1               n=1
        f(nâˆ’1)+2**(nâˆ’1) n>1

(a) Write a recursive function that takes as its single argument an
integer â‰¥ 1 and prints out that number of terms from the above series.

(b) Write a program that prompts the user for a series of integers.
For each number entered the program should check that it is greater
than or equal to 1. If it is, it calls the function defined in part (a).
The program should stop when a zero or a negative number is entered.

(c) In your function, include some print statements that allow you to see
the operation of the recursion and its progress towards the base case.
