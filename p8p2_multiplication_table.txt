'''
PROGRAM p8p2
Write a program that prompts the user for a number and
uses a while loop to generate the “multiplication table” for that number
from 1 up to the number. For example, if the user were to enter “5”,
the following table would be generated:

1 2 3 4 5
2 4 6 8 10
3 6 9 12 15
4 8 12 16 20
5 10 15 20 25

PSEUDO-CODE
initialize i to 1
prompt user for a number (which defines the table size as well)
while i < number do
    initialize j to 1
    while j <= number
        print i*j, set print cursor after a space (to get rid of the new line) with end =" "
        increment j
    print a new line print()
    Increment i
'''

i = 1
number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
while i <= number:
    j = 1
    while j <= number:
        print(i*j, end = " ")
        j+=1
    print()
    i+=1
